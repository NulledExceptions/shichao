Intro
=====

I find it interesting to learn internals of operating systems and networks, because it's fun to understand how things work behind the scenes. As a site reliability engineer, I work on making large-scale complex systems reliable using DevOps and systems engineering techniques. I think with in-depth knowledge in systems and a solid background in relevant fields, it would be confident to write better programs.
