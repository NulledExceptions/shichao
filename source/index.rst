Info
====

* I'm Shichao An.
* I'm enthusiastic about free and open source software.
* I'm active on GitHub.
* I regularly use OS X, Fedora and Ubuntu.

Intro
=====

I find it interesting to learn internals of operating systems and networks, because it's fun to understand how things work behind the scenes. As a site reliability engineer, I work on making large-scale complex systems reliable using DevOps and system engineering techniques. I think with in-depth knowledge in systems and a solid background in relevant fields, it would be confident to write better programs.

Interest
========

* UNIX and Linux
* Python, Ruby and Go
