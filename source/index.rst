Self Introduction
=================

I'm Shichao An, a computer science graduate from the `New York University <https://www.nyu.edu/>`_. Enthusiastic about free and open source software, I am very active on `GitHub <https://github.com/shichao-an>`_. I regularly use Fedora, OS X and Ubuntu.

Currently, I'm working as a system administrator. I find it helpful to learn the internals of operating systems and networks having such an infrastructure role as a beginner. It's also fun to work on site reliability and system engineering, which makes me understand how things work and provides solid background and inspirational motives for writing better programs.

Technical Interest
==================

* UNIX and Linux
* Python, Ruby and Go
